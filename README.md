Use Telegram channel as a minimal databases! ðŸš€ It's **fast**, faster than I
expected it to be, and like Telegram, it's **free**, **unlimited** and ðŸ”“
**secure**, because you know, it is using Telegram's storage ðŸ˜¬. You may want to
look at

## What is this?

With this library, you can use your **private** or **public**
[Telegram](https://telegram.org) channel as minimal databases for your projects.
Create multiple databases, add, edit and delete records. It's still a small
concept and pretty bad code.
